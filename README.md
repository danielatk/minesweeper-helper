## Usage
This extension allows users to see real-time analysis of the current minesweeper.online board.
This has been adapted from JSMinesweeper (https://github.com/DavidNHill/JSMinesweeper).
There is also an option to save the board of any minesweeper.online game currently active in plain text.
The format is compatible with JSMinesweeper board exports.
